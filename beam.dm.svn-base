obj/Attacks/proc/BeamDescription() desc="[src] drains [KiReq]x energy to use. Does [WaveMult]x \
damage. Charges higher every [ChargeRate*5] seconds. Has a range of [round(MaxDistance/MoveDelay)]. \
And moves at [round(100/MoveDelay)] kilometers an hour. All stats listed are when the beam is \
fully trained. By practicing beams you can increase their \
charging speed, and movement speed, and range."
