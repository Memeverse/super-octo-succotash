	desc="Glory of the Divine is a masterable skill. The more past your mastery you use the faster you \
	master it. Glory of the Divine can only be set to a maximum of 20, but you can master beyond 20. But since \
	your mastery past that is ever-higher than the max amount you can use, your mastery slows \
	further and further past 20. The amount of power you gain per level depends on your mastery, \
	that is why mastering it is important, a person with 1x mastery using 1x will get about 1000 \
	power, a person with 20 mastered who uses 1x will get about 20000 power for instance. Glory of the Divine \
	will drain your health when using it, you can decrease the amount it drains \
	by mastering it further, but each level adds more drain to be mastered. While in Glory of the Divine, not \
	only will your power increase, but your movement speed will also greatly increase, but you will \
	lose a lot of defense as well. Also while using this your combo chance will automatically go \
	to 100%, despite what it is when your not using Glory of the Divine. Using more than double your mastery and \
	running out of health will kill you"
